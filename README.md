# It's ugly. But it works 
I am not even able to imagine a case in which you might need it. Apparently, if you wanna convert some a HUGE JSON into a YAML-file that would fit your scriptable object config in the Unity Editor... but that's kinda rare case. 

It worked for JSONs of 3GB. I am proud of it. It's slow. But nor do I care.

Thanks.
